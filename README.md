# GPT Text Generation with PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model using PyTorch. GPT is a state-of-the-art language generation model that uses self-attention mechanisms to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- Definition of the GPT architecture using PyTorch.
- Training of the GPT model on text data.
- Text generation using the trained model.

## How it Works

### Model Architecture
- The GPT model consists of multiple layers of transformer blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks.
- The model tokenizes input text and generates predictions for the next token in the sequence.

### Training
- The model is trained using an Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
- During training, the model learns to generate text that closely matches the input data.

### Text Generation
- To generate text, the model takes a context sequence as input and predicts the next token in the sequence.
- This process is repeated iteratively to generate a sequence of tokens, forming coherent text.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- PyTorch: A deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data and training progress.

Example:-
To generate text, simply provide a starting prompt:

python
Copy code
gen('it was a rainy day')
### Credits
This implementation is based on the GPT architecture and training methodology proposed by Andrej Karpathy and the original paper by OpenAI.
